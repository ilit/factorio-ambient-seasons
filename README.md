# factorio-ambient-seasons

I guess I'll bail out from modding season changing mod. Lua's performance in iterating over arrays which must be the most CPU cache-friendly data structure is terrible.

Implemented snow tiles appear over and dissappear over time starting from highest "elevation" ingame noise values.

Implemented Voronoi tesselation of game surface to make any amount of alien biomes with procedurally generated color combinations for tiles, decorations and trees.
